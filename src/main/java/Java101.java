    //Exercise 2
    //Create a variable named fruits and assign it to an array of strings containing the following fruits.
    // mango, banana, guava, kiwi, strawberry
    String[] fruits = {"mango", "banana", "guava", "kiwi", "strawberry"};

    //Exercise 3
    //Create a var name vegatable and assign it to an array of fruits containing the following vegatable names as strings:
    //eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower, and zucchini

    String[] vegetables = {"eggplant", "broccoli", "carrot", "cauliflower", "zucchini"};

    //Exercise 4
    //Create a variable named numbers and assign it to an array of numbers: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
    String[] numbers = {"1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"};

    //Exercise 5
    // Add a string "tomato" to the end of the fruits array.
    //*Hint* Recommend finding and using a built-in JS operations to add to an array rather than recreating the array.
    //*Hint* in Java, find and use a different way to work around this...
